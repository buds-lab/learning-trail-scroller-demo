              Integral to the concept of net-zero energy for SDE4 is the need to rethink strategies of design and implementation for air-conditioning, which accounts for over 60 percent of the buildingâ€™s total energy load.The resulting solution was innovative, mixed-mode hybrid cooling system, that ensures excellent indoor air quality and optimum cooling of spaces.

          <div class="title">Adaptive Comfort </div>
              
              SDE4 gives users greater control over their immediate environment through openable windows and adjustable fans speeds. This allows the occupants to adapt to (or even prefer) a wider range of thermal conditions that are beyond conventional boundaries of thermal comfort in the tropics.

             SDE4's hybrid cooling system is a single-pass system with no recirculated air that supplies rooms with pre-cooled air, albeit at higher temperatures and humidity levels than in a conventional system, with the addition of elevated air speed by ceiling fans. This cool circulating air generates a comfort condition that is significantly better than conventional overcooled spaces. This system is augmented with natural ventilation by means of operable windows to allow fresh air into the space.

          <div class="title">Enhanced IEQ</div>
              
              SDE4 uses a single-pass pre-cooled fresh air system and operable windows to condition spaces. The hybrid cooling zones achieve a much higher indoor air quality in comparison to traditional air conditioning systems augmented with natural daylighting due to an optimised envelope design. Additionally, allowing users to further control ceiling fans for elevated thermal comfort further enhances the indoor environmental quality of the building.
