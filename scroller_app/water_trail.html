              Water is a precondition for living systems and an instrument of mental and spiritual well-being. Effective management of water - quality and volume - is critical towards achieving net zero energy targets for buildings in the tropics. SDE4 uses various strategies for water management while integrating water sensitive design features with land development.

          <div class="title">ABC Water Programme</div>
              
              Active, Beautiful, Clean(ABC) Waters programme outlines natural purification processes to protect water quality, enhance biodiversity and reduce flow of stormwater runoff from the built landscape. SDE4 is a ABC Waters site which uses a combination of on-site retention and rainwater harvesting strategies to bring the community closer to water.

          <div class="title">Water Feature</div>
              
             SDE4â€™s landscape seamlessly integrates greenery, water and community through spaces that support everyday activities, teaching and research. For instance, this water feature is only active when it rains - adding sound, texture and movement to the landscape while also being as a pedagogical tool for teaching and research.

          <div class="title">Bio Retention Basin</div>
              
              At SDE4, one third of the roof rainwater runoff is conveyed into the bioretention basin which slows down the stormwater run-off, embellishes the landscape and filters water through a dense vegetation layer. This harvested water is then used for irrigation and other non potable water demands of the building.
