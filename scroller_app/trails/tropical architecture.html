              Tropical Architecture is the use of design strategies to create a well performing, climate responsive built environment for the tropics.
              SDE4â€™s design approach demonstrates a deep understanding of climatic conditions in Singapore. Its contemporary design interpretation of age old design philosophies make the building perform well and be contextually relevant in the tropical locale of Singapore.

        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Building Orientation and Form</div>
              
              SDE4 is designed in response to Singapore's tropical climate - with orientation of the building along the East-West direction to minimize direct solar heat gain and maximise cross flow of prevailing winds. It takes into consideration seasonality, sun movement, natural shade and other environmental factors such as wind, rainfall, and humidity, to design comfortable and energy efficient spaces.

        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Shading and Envelope Design</div>
              
             SDE4's large oversailing roof provides coverage from direct sunlight and limits undesirable heat gain from solar radiation. This coupled with shading screens on the east & west facades and localised horizontal sunshades on windows are used to direct diffused daylight deeper into the building.

        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Natural Ventilation</div>
              
              SDE4's design is comprised of large open spaces, with the internal volumes being broken down into smaller forms for minimal obstruction to windflow.
              The building orientation faces the natural direction of wind flow across the site, enabling cross ventilation across the entire block.

        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Beauty/ Landscape Design</div>
              
              SDE4's surrounding landscape provides shading to the second and third storeys of the building, mitigates urban heat island around the block, helps reduce noise and improves air quality. For the higher floors, the landscape has a positive impact on occupant experience and well being from a biophilic standpoint.
