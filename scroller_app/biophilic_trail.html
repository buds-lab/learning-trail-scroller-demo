              Biophilic design is a fundamental to SDE4, exhibited by its open design, visual and physical connection with nature and natural elements and the presence of nature both indoors and in its surroundings. SDE4 uses biophilic design principles to establish, nurture and enhance its relationship with its sorroundings. Incorporation of biophilic principles help reduce stress, enhance clarity of thought, improve well-being, and expedite healing for its occupants.

          <div class="title">Nature In Place</div>
              
              Nature in place addresses the direct, physical and ephemeral presence of nature in a space or place. SDE4 incorporates nature in place through the external landscaping and large trees, the level 6 courtyard, and a water feature that becomes activated when it rains. The building also allows for air flow to vary with the outdoor conditions, and both dynamic and diffused light to enter.

          <div class="title">Nature of Place</div>
              
             Nature of place addresses spatial configurations in nature and draws upon the human attribute to see beyond their immediate surroundings and a fascination with the unknown.
            SDE4 explores and incorporates nature of space by virtue of its open design, providing visual connections coupled with physical sheltering. This evokes a sense of intrigue and wonder, all being experienced within the safety of the habitat for its inhabitants.

          <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Materiality</div>
              
             The experience of natural analogues by virtue of manifestation in organic, non-living and indirect evocations of nature is the underlying concept of materiality. This includes objects, materials, colours, shapes, sequences and patterns found in nature, replicated or mimicked within the built environment in various forms. SDE4â€™s use of raw concrete, timber fixtures and fitting and floor patterns create an esoteric yet comprehensible analogues to nature and biophilia.
