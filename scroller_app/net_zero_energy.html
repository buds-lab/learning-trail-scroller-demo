              SDE4 is a Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB), which means it consumes as much energy as it produces within its site boundary. Consumption and production figures are balanced over the course of one year, allowing for periods when consumption is higher than production and vice versa. For energy generation, SDE4 relies on an array of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on its roof. It minimises energy demand by using energy efficient appliances and optimizing building systems like air conditioning and lighting.

          <div class="title">Energy Generation</div>
              
              SDE4 uses the 1225 solar photoVoltaic cells istalled on its roof for renewable energy generation. These cells generate over 500 MWh of energy per year, which is equivalent to its annual energy consumption. 
              The annual energy balance is be maintained with the cityâ€™s utility grid by supplying surplus energy back into the grid and drawing energy from the grid in case of higher demand.

          <div class="title">Demand Reduction</div>
              
             The innovative hybrid cooling system implemented in SDE4 plays a major role in the reduction of overall annual energy demand. By designing a single pass system with no recirculated air, the cooled spaces have 100% fresh air supply. Temperature and humidity levels of the delivered air are set higher than a conventional system and augmented with elevated air speed to provide optimum thermal comfort to the occupants. 
            The use of energy efficient lighting fixtures, augmented by a building form that allows ample usable natural light into the spaces, results in a substantial reduction in lighting energy loads.
